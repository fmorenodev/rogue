# ROGUE 

a GODOT-based roguelike

## IMPLEMENT:
- world generation
	- ~~improve world gen to make it tile_based~~
	- tweak new world gen
	- ~~fix positioning issue for entities upon spawn~~
	- ~~fix world gen upon retry/new dungeon level (less entities spawn?)~~
- improve spawning to make it more evenly distributed
	- ~~no spawning in corridor entrances (find how to detect them)~~
	- ~~fix entities spawning upon the player~~
	- check max enemies in certain area
- map clearing and advancing to the next map
	- rewards for clearing map
- player interaction with entities
	- ~~item pickup (using inventory)~~
	- skills and ranged attacks
	- neutral or allied interactions with actors
- ~~inventory~~
- implement neutral and ally NPCs
- loading screen
	- ~~make graphic/animation for loading screen~~
	- fix loading / event order to make it dissappear when the map is generated
- refactor nodes and scripts to make each node or script do less things and be more organized
	- ~~add diagonal movement~~
	- fix diagonal movement / pressing two or more movement inputs at the same time.
- general fixes
	- add a new tile for the background to distinguish it / parallax background (not possible to do this kind of bg)
	- ~~fix player / enemy behaviour~~
	- ~~bug: when inventory is full, taking the same item later doesn't remove it from the floor until you pass it again~~
	- bug: when calculating a path, if the path is blocked by an entity, move around (or possibly update the a* map with the square each untraversable entity occupies at the end of each turn)

## DESIGN: when designed move to implement with the decided implementation
- decide on aesthetic for the game
	- bw / 1 bit (maybe)
	- realistic color palette (i don't think so)
	- limited color palette (maybe)
	- setting / aesthetic based new fonts (must search first)
- decide on setting for the game
	- post-apocalyptic
	- futuristic
	- medieval
	- fantasy
	- oniric / surreal
- bigger tiles?
	- 32 x 32
	- asymmetric (16 x 32)
- design and decide additional inputs:
	- open screen:
		- menu
		- char sheet
		- log / quests / relations
		- no map needed
		- inventory
		- etc
	- alternative interactions:
		- talk
		- shoot / skill / magic
		- look at tile
		- etc
- design additional entities
- design expected enemy behaviour
	- universal enemy AI
	- specfic enemy AI
	- enemy death behaviour
- design classes or loadouts
	- implement skills / perks / etc
- menu styling
	- create better design for the menus
	- graphics based on setting / aesthetic
